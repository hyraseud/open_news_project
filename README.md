# npm-start

[npm start](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-start.html) 

```
npm install 
npm start
```

## Start server side

```
$ cd server
$ npm-start
```

## Start client side

```
$ cd client
$ npm-start
```


Also memory usage for long running processes might be a bit lower since you do not need to spawn an additional node process to start npm
